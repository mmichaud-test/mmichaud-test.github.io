					  <h2>Pathfinder 2e Remastered Eberron</h2>
				   </section>
				</div>
			 </section>
			 <p>The features that most set Eberron apart are its tone and attitude. The setting combines traditional medieval fantasy with <b>pulp action</b> and <b>dark adventure</b>. 
			 Make no mistake&mdash;the world of Eberron proudly takes its place among the D&amp;D worlds that have come before&comma; with a cinematic flair and an eye toward the best 
			 action-adventure movies ever filmed. The campaign&rsquor;s story elements were designed with this in mind.</p>
			 <p>The world of Eberron has a rich history built on heroic deeds&comma; evolving magic&comma; and the <b>wounds of a long&comma; devastating war</b>. In the 
			 wake of this Last War&comma; action&comma; adventure&comma; good&comma; evil&comma; and a <b>thousand shades of gray paint</b> the landscape in broad&comma; powerful strokes&comma; 
			 and ancient mysteries await discovery so that they too can influence the world and its people.</p>
			 <p><b>Magic</b> is built into the very fabric of the setting. It <b>pervades and influences everyday life</b>. It provides certain <b>comforts and conveniences</b> unknown in either 
			 the modern world or any world of medieval fantasy. Great cities where castles scrape the sky can be found throughout the continent of Khorvaire&comma; and a thriving 
			 aristocracy of merchant families controls much of the world&rsquor;s economy thanks to the edge given them by the mysterious and rare <b>dragonmarks</b>.</p>
			 <p>Heroes come in all shapes and sizes&comma; all classes and races. They travel the world&comma; battling villains and recovering fabulous treasure&comma; dealing with 
			 over-the-top action&comma; harrowing challenges&comma; cliffhanger situations&comma; narrow escapes&comma; and ominous mysteries that are as likely to shed light on centuries 
			 of secrets as they are to threaten the safety of the current day</p>

			<h1>Daelkyr Half-Blood</h1>
			<div class="wide flavor subtitle">The Daelkyr half-blood is a versatile heritage, blending aberrant resilience with mortal adaptability to thrive despite the threats of corruption and madness.</div>
            <p>Despite being sealed away under the earth, a daelkyr can reproduce, after a fashion. A daelkyr's corporeal incarceration constantly leaks the virulence of its corrupting spirit. The 
			unborn are especially vulnerable to this influence, and those innocents growing in the wombs of their mothers within the sphere of this beastly influence are born as daelkyr half-bloods.</p>
			<p>Daelkyr half-bloods are born of pregnant mothers who were either influenced by close proximity to a daelkyr confinement cylinder or infected by a breed leech. Transformed in the womb from the 
			natural creature they might have otherwise become, half-bloods are instead born as aberrations, the knowledge of which each new daelkyr half-blood can embrace or reject as its own true nature 
			becomes clear. Daelkyr half-blood typically goes on to serve daelkyr goals.  And still, there are some who resist—fragile minds waging a quiet inner war against the ancient dread whispering that their 
			purpose lies in serving the Xoriat's overlord. However, the birth of a daelkyr half-blood is always accompanied by the afterbirth of a symbiont, twin to the daelkyr half-blood, if different in form and ability. 
			Child and symbiont share an unnatural attraction, despite the horror of parents who might be tempted to cast out both. Such hard-luck half-bloods, shunned by their parents, might be more drawn to daelkyr ideals 
			than those of their biological forebears.</p>
			<img alt="eberron_monster" style="top: 602px;right: 371px;transform: scaleX(-1);width: 525px;" class="monster" src="./images/hblood.png" />
			<div class="column-break"></div>
			<p>Half-bloods often give themselves to melancholy, anguish, and fits of extreme anger. More than most creatures, half-bloods can be of two minds on a particular subject, almost as if they indeed possessed
			two physical minds, and not just one like most creatures. Half-bloods tend to avoid the spotlight, especially in urban environments where their true nature might be revealed through too 
			much exposure to common folk. As such, they prefer dark corners, night, and sidestreets.</p>
			<p>Anguish burns in the eyes of daelkyr half-bloods, because their spirits are always in conflict. The most obvious outward sign that a creature has been "womb-warped" is the natural 
			symbiont that is first birthed with a daelkyr half-blood (the symbiont is sometimes mistaken for a disfigured twin or gruesome afterbirth), then later befriended, worn, and utilized by 
			the adult half-blood.</p>
			<h3>You Might...</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Hide your true nature, avoiding attention and staying in the shadows to protect yourself and others from your disturbing twin.</li>
				<li>Experience intense emotions, such as sudden anger or deep melancholy, and may act unpredictably due to your dual-minded nature.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Others Probably...</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>React with fear or disgust upon seeing your twin, often leading to rejection or hostility.</li>
				<li>Show cautious curiosity if they can look past appearances, potentially offering friendship or alliance if trust is earned.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Daelkyr Half-blood (Rare Heritage)</h3>
			<p>Your mother's womb was warped by the daelkyr influence. Your symbiot twin is the most obvious signifier of this parentage, but you likely also have voidlike eyes, hairless skin or 
			any unusual feature for a members of your other parent’s ancestry. You start with a level 1 uncommon symbiot and you gain the aberration trait. Your unique metabolism 
			effectively fights off diseases, You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against diseases. You also gain darkvision. You can select from half-blood feats and feats from your other 
			parent’s ancestry whenever you gain an ancestry feat.</p>

					 <p><br/>Life with your symbiot has never been peaceful. Speaking with it is like talking to a warped version of yourself — violent, sadistic, and utterly merciless. Though the bond you 
					 share with your twin is a strange one, it’s marked by a twisted loyalty that no one can truly understand.</p>
					 <p>Whatever happen, your symbiot's attitude should never get worse than indifferent (at the GM's discretion). However, the twin symbiot would never accept any separation from you.</p>
					 <p>Your facility with your symbiont usage comes at a price. Without daily contact with your twin, you begins to die. If you has no contact with the symbiont for 24 hours, you gain the 
					 drained 2 condition. You increase this condition by 2 more every 24 hours until contact is restored. As long as you remains separated from your twin, a full night's rest won't decreases any 
					 drained condition value.<br/><br/></p>
