			<h1>Dragonmarks</h1>
			
			<p>A dragonmark is a magical symbol that manifests on the skin, but its color immediately differentiates it from any mundane tattoo. A dragonmark is etched in shades 
			of blue, green, and purple so vivid that they appear to glow, though the mark provides no real illumination.</p>
			<p>A dragonmark is associated with one or more magical abilities, and a person who carries a dragonmark can exercise these powers. When a bearer invokes the power of 
			a dragonmark, its colors shimmer and flow, and the skin grows warm to the touch. The mark grows warmer each time its power is used over the course of a day; by the 
			time the bearer has expended his full allotment of spell-like abilities, the mark is fever-hot and cannot be used again until it cools. Shapechanging ability and 
			illusions can mimic a dragonmark's appearance, but usually cannot make it warm to the touch.</p>
			<p>In keeping with their magical nature, dragonmarks are not simply skin deep. If a mark is eut or scarred, it reappears as the skin that bears it magically heals. 
			If a warrior loses the hand that bears his dragonmark, the mark will manifest elsewhere on his body. Creatures under the effect of polymorph, wild shape, and other 
			shapechanging effects retain their dragonmarks unless they specifically will them to be hidden.</p>
			<p>Nearly all dragonmarked heirs first manifest the least mark of their house. When a character increases her dragonmark’s power, the mark physically expands. A 
			typicalleast dragonmark covers an area 2 inches square on the skin. Lesser marks are typically 3-5 inches across, while greater dragonmarks are 6-8 inches. Siberys 
			dragonmarks are vast designs that often cover the bearer's entire chest or torso.</p>
			<h3>MARKED BY BLOOD</h3>
			<p>Dragonmarks are tied to bloodlines. The dragonmarked houses are the descendants of the families that first manifested the marks, and a character with a dragonmark 
			can always find a connection to a dragonmarked house somewhere in the roots of his family tree.</p>
			<p>Though the appearance of marks cannot be consistently predicted, approximately half the children born to dragonmarked parents eventually develop dragonmarks of 
			their own. Common belief holds that parents with powerful marks are more likely to produce gifted children; likewise, children often develop the same powers as their 
			parents. Within House Sivis, members of the Torralyn family typically manifest whispering wind, while Syrralans are more likely to possess the power of arcane mark. 
			Houses often arrange marriages with marks in mind.</p>
			<p>Despite these beliefs, dragonmarks are clearly about more than selective breeding. A child born to parents possessing least marks might later manifest the greater 
			mark, or no mark at all. It is also known that the hybrid races cannot inherit the marks oftheir parents, so that a human cannot pass the Mark of Making to a half-elf 
			child. A member of a dragonmarked house reincarnated as another race keeps his dragonmark, but children born to such transformed creatures never possess the dragonmark 
			of the parent's original race. Though legend states that Erandis d'Vol, the last known heir ofthe Mark of Death, was a half-dragon, only the Mark of Finding is known 
			to cross racial barriers, manifesting on both humans and half-orcs.</p>
			<h3>THE TEST OF SIBERYS</h3>
			<p>Children are not born with dragonmarks. Rather, a dragonmark most often appears in response to a stressful situation in which the powers of the mark could prove 
			useful. A Jorasco heir feels her dragonmark flare to life as her best friend lies dying. A Medani scion instinctively realizes the meal he is about to eat is poisoned, 
			and in an instant of burning pain, his mark appears.</p>
			<p> The Test of Siberys—a rite of passage undertaken by the adolescent children of the dragonmarked houses—is rumored to induce the kind of extreme stress needed for 
			dragonmarks to manifest. The test varies from house to house, and is based both on the powers ofthe markand the traditions of the family. Outsiders, even those of 
			dragonmarked houses, know little of what goes on in a particular house’s test. l'hough a person can fail the test and still manifest a mark at a later age (as shown 
			by the fact that a player character can manifest a mark at any time), this is rare. As a rule, it is assumed that those who fail will never develop a dragonmark.</p>
			<p>The Test of Siberys shapes the future of a character. A successful child emerges as a dragonmarked lord with a vital role to play in his family's future; one who 
			fails still maintains the privileges of her bloodline, but must fight to prove her worth in the mundane offices of her house.</p>

			<h2>Dragonmarks rules</h2>
			<p>To possess a dragonmark, a character must take the Least Dragonmark Ancestry feat. They can increase the power of the dragonmark by adding the Lesser 
			Dragonmark and Greater Dragonmark feats. Dragonmarked feats are Ancestry feats, however their is some General or Skill Feats tied to particular mark at the end of this chapter.</p>

			<h1>Mark of Detection</h1>
			<div class="wide flavor subtitle" style="padding-bottom:10px;">&nbsp;</div>
			<p>The Mark of Detection grants abilities that enable its possessor to discern the presence of threats, from poisoned food to scrying eyes.</p>
			<h3>House Medani</h3>
			<p>The half-elves of House Medani carry the Mark of Detection. One of the youngest of the dragonmarked houses, House Medani organized into a mercantile house as a 
			result of the War of the Mark that ended fifteen hundred years ago. Despite the fact that it has stood as an established mercantile house for fifteen centuries, some 
			of the older houses still view House Medani as an upstart. Unconcerned with the opinions of its peers, House Medani controls the Warning Guild, which offers services 
			related to personal protection. House Medani originated in Breland and continues to concentrate its efforts in the central region of Khorvaire.  Unmarked members of 
			House Medani sell their services as scouts, sentries, and similar occupations.</p>

			<h3>House Tharashk</h3>
			<p>House Tharashk is a family of half-orcs and humans originally from the region around the Shadow Marches. It controls the Finders Guild, which includes free lance 
			inquisitives, some law enforcement agents, explorers for-hire, and dragonshard prospectors. The Finders Guild concentrates its efforts in western Khorvaire, where a 
			lucrative dragonshard prospecting business flourishes, although its members are found in every major town and city. The unmarked members of House Tharashk assist 
			their dragonmarked kin in every area; they offer mundane investigative services and help on dragonshard prospecting expeditions.</p>

			<h1>Mark of Handling</h1>
			<div class="wide flavor subtitle" style="padding-bottom:10px;">&nbsp;</div>
			<p>The Mark of Handling gifts do not win battles or drive the commerce of nations; the house was not instrumental in the Last War or in establishing the traditions of 
			the houses. Its mark allows it to better care for and control animals; while useful, this ability is hardly the stuff of legend. Yet somehow, this inconspicuous house 
			carries more than its share of controversy.</p>
			<h3>House Vadalis</h3>
			<p> The humans of House Vadalis carry the Mark of Handling. Their Handlers Guild controls the business of breeding and selling livestock throughout Khorvaire. 
			Though the elves of Valenar are gaining a reputation for breeding the finest horses in Khorvaire, their steeds are rare and expensive, while House Vadalis 
			provides a strong, loyal, and affordable mount. Unmarked members of House Vadalis are animal handlers, breeders, auctioneers, stablekeepers, drivers, and teamsters</p>

			<h1>Mark of Healing</h1>
			<div class="wide flavor subtitle" style="padding-bottom:10px;">&nbsp;</div>
			<p>The halflings who bear the Mark of Healing have saved countless lives through their good works. They heal the sick and the dying, and provide comfort and respite 
			for those whom even magic cannot cure. They often work hand in hand with House Ghallanda, giving travelers access to healing and aid even in remote areas. By those 
			who owe their health or life to the Mark of Healing, the bearers’ name is praised.</p>
			<h3>House Jorasco</h3>
			<p>The halflings of House Jorasco carry the Mark of Healing and operate the Healers Guild, which controls both the mundane and magical healing trades. A sick or 
			injured person in Khorvaire is far more likely to seek healing from the Healers Guild than from any temple, and in fact most temples do not offer healing services for 
			sale (though they still heal their own champions and faithful when necessary). Unmarked members of House Jorasco are expertly trained in the healing arts, as well as 
			in fields such as alchemy and herbalism.</p>

			<p>For centuries, bearers of the Mark of Hospitality roamed the Talenta Plains, offering food and shelter to the needy. They sponsored glorious feasts for the heroes of the plains,

			<h3>House Ghallanda</h3>
			<p>The halflings of House Ghallanda carry the Mark of Hospitality, which is extremely useful in the halflings’ native nomadic culture. In the cities of Khorvaire, House Ghallanda operates the Hostelers Guild, 
			whose members include innkeepers, chefs, and restaurateurs. While the guild does not operate every inn and dining establishment in Khorvaire, it enforces standards and performs inspections to regulate those

			<h1>Mark of Making</h1>
			<div class="wide flavor subtitle" style="padding-bottom:10px;">&nbsp;</div>
			<p>The Mark of Making grants its bearers a natural talent for creation and repair. With a touch, broken tools, worn constructs, and shattered devices are restored to perfection. Magical mending is more than art—it 
			underpins industry and commerce, keeping the gears of invention turning and shaping the very economy of the world.</p>
			<h3>House Cannith</h3>
			<p>The humans of House Cannith carry the Mark of Making. Members of their Tinkers Guild often travel as widely as more traditional tinkers, stopping in villages to repair goods as they go. House Cannith also 
			runs the Fabricators Guild, whose members include those with lesser or greater marks who can fabricate new items rather than just repair old ones. Unmarked members of House Cannith are well-to-do artisans and, 
			less often, mundane tinkers.</p>

			means of sending. In addition, House Sivis controls the Notaries Guild, which uses arcane mark to certify legal documents and similar work. This guild also prepares secure documents intended for specific recipients 
			using illusory script and performs transcription and copying services. House Sivis originated in Zilargo and has spread along with the gnomes throughout the Five Nations. The house does not usually operate in 
			regions where gnomes are rare. The unmarked members of House Sivis serve as mediators, scribes, messengers, go-betweens, and sometimes diplomats.</p>

			<p>The Mark of Shadow grants divinatory powers of clairvoyance, as well as illusory powers of deception.</p>
			<h3>Elven houses</h3>
			<p>One of the most surprising and devastating effects of the Last War was the schism of the family that carries the Mark of Shadow. House Phiarlan, an elf family of ancient lineage, carried the Mark of Shadow for 
			millennia before the Last War and was known as an information clearinghouse. During the war, however, the mission of the house turned its members against each other, eventually resulting in the formation of a new 
			house—House Thuranni.</p>
			<p>The two houses continue their ancient work of espionage, surveillance, and similar intelligence-gathering activities, while outwardly pursuing mercantile activities based on entertainment and artisan endeavors. 
			House Phiarlan’s Entertainers and Artisans Guild is based in Breland, and its spies work for (or sell information to) Thrane, Aundair, and Breland. House Thuranni, based in the Lhazaar Principalities (but with an 
			enclave in Breland), controls the Shadow Network. Its members perform their spying activities on behalf of the Lhazaar princelings, Karrnath, Droaam, Q’barra, and even the Order of the Emerald Claw. Unmarked 
			members of both House Phiarlan and House Thuranni work as entertainers and artisans who gather information and serve as spies and rogues.
