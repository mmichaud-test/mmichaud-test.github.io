			<h1>Dragonmarks</h1>
			
			<p>A dragonmark is a magical symbol that manifests on the skin, but its color immediately differentiates it from any mundane tattoo. A dragonmark is etched in shades 
			of blue, green, and purple so vivid that they appear to glow, though the mark provides no real illumination.</p>
			<p>A dragonmark is associated with one or more magical abilities, and a person who carries a dragonmark can exercise these powers. When a bearer invokes the power of 
			a dragonmark, its colors shimmer and flow, and the skin grows warm to the touch. The mark grows warmer each time its power is used over the course of a day; by the 
			time the bearer has expended his full allotment of spell-like abilities, the mark is fever-hot and cannot be used again until it cools. Shapechanging ability and 
			illusions can mimic a dragonmark's appearance, but usually cannot make it warm to the touch.</p>
			<p>In keeping with their magical nature, dragonmarks are not simply skin deep. If a mark is eut or scarred, it reappears as the skin that bears it magically heals. 
			If a warrior loses the hand that bears his dragonmark, the mark will manifest elsewhere on his body. Creatures under the effect of polymorph, wild shape, and other 
			shapechanging effects retain their dragonmarks unless they specifically will them to be hidden.</p>
			<p>Nearly all dragonmarked heirs first manifest the least mark of their house. When a character increases her dragonmark’s power, the mark physically expands. A 
			typicalleast dragonmark covers an area 2 inches square on the skin. Lesser marks are typically 3-5 inches across, while greater dragonmarks are 6-8 inches. Siberys 
			dragonmarks are vast designs that often cover the bearer's entire chest or torso.</p>
			<h3>MARKED BY BLOOD</h3>
			<p>Dragonmarks are tied to bloodlines. The dragonmarked houses are the descendants of the families that first manifested the marks, and a character with a dragonmark 
			can always find a connection to a dragonmarked house somewhere in the roots of his family tree.</p>
			<p>Though the appearance of marks cannot be consistently predicted, approximately half the children born to dragonmarked parents eventually develop dragonmarks of 
			their own. Common belief holds that parents with powerful marks are more likely to produce gifted children; likewise, children often develop the same powers as their 
			parents. Within House Sivis, members of the Torralyn family typically manifest whispering wind, while Syrralans are more likely to possess the power of arcane mark. 
			Houses often arrange marriages with marks in mind.</p>
			<p>Despite these beliefs, dragonmarks are clearly about more than selective breeding. A child born to parents possessing least marks might later manifest the greater 
			mark, or no mark at all. It is also known that the hybrid races cannot inherit the marks oftheir parents, so that a human cannot pass the Mark of Making to a half-elf 
			child. A member of a dragonmarked house reincarnated as another race keeps his dragonmark, but children born to such transformed creatures never possess the dragonmark 
			of the parent's original race. Though legend states that Erandis d'Vol, the last known heir ofthe Mark of Death, was a half-dragon, only the Mark of Finding is known 
			to cross racial barriers, manifesting on both humans and half-orcs.</p>
			<h3>THE TEST OF SIBERYS</h3>
			<p>Children are not born with dragonmarks. Rather, a dragonmark most often appears in response to a stressful situation in which the powers of the mark could prove 
			useful. A Jorasco heir feels her dragonmark flare to life as her best friend lies dying. A Medani scion instinctively realizes the meal he is about to eat is poisoned, 
			and in an instant of burning pain, his mark appears.</p>
			<p> The Test of Siberys—a rite of passage undertaken by the adolescent children of the dragonmarked houses—is rumored to induce the kind of extreme stress needed for 
			dragonmarks to manifest. The test varies from house to house, and is based both on the powers ofthe markand the traditions of the family. Outsiders, even those of 
			dragonmarked houses, know little of what goes on in a particular house’s test. l'hough a person can fail the test and still manifest a mark at a later age (as shown 
			by the fact that a player character can manifest a mark at any time), this is rare. As a rule, it is assumed that those who fail will never develop a dragonmark.</p>
			<p>The Test of Siberys shapes the future of a character. A successful child emerges as a dragonmarked lord with a vital role to play in his family's future; one who 
			fails still maintains the privileges of her bloodline, but must fight to prove her worth in the mundane offices of her house.</p>

			<h2>Dragonmarks rules</h2>
			<p>To possess a dragonmark, a character must take the Least Dragonmark Ancestry feat. They can increase the power of the dragonmark by adding the Lesser 
			Dragonmark and Greater Dragonmark feats. Dragonmarked feats are Ancestry feats, however their is some General or Skill Feats tied to particular mark at the end of this chapter.</p>

			<h1>Mark of Detection</h1>
			<div class="wide flavor subtitle">The Mark of Detection powers makes bodyguard and investigator better at their job.</div>
			<p>The Mark of Detection grants abilities that enable its possessor to discern the presence of threats, from poisoned food to scrying eyes.</p>
			<h3>House Medani</h3>
			<p>The half-elves of House Medani carry the Mark of Detection. One of the youngest of the dragonmarked houses, House Medani organized into a mercantile house as a 
			result of the War of the Mark that ended fifteen hundred years ago. Despite the fact that it has stood as an established mercantile house for fifteen centuries, some 
			of the older houses still view House Medani as an upstart. Unconcerned with the opinions of its peers, House Medani controls the Warning Guild, which offers services 
			related to personal protection. House Medani originated in Breland and continues to concentrate its efforts in the central region of Khorvaire.  Unmarked members of 
			House Medani sell their services as scouts, sentries, and similar occupations.</p>
