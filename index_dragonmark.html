			<h1>Dragonmarks</h1>
			<div class="wide flavor subtitle">Bound by bloodlines, dragonmarks grant their bearers innate spell-like abilities</div>
			<p>Magic is the lifeblood of Eberron, encircling it like the Ring of Siberys and seeping up through the earth from the bones of Khyber. Perhaps the clearest 
			manifestation of this pervasive magic is the appearance of dragonmarks among seven of Khorvaire’s common races. Dragonmarks are elaborate skin patterns—more intricate 
			and colorful than birthmarks, more distinctive than any tattoo—that also grant their bearers innate spell-like abilities. There are twelve families of dragonmarks, 
			each one associated with a number of closely related manifestations. A thirteenth mark, the Mark of Death, has faded from history, and no living creature on Eberron 
			carries it.</p>
			<h2>Dragonmarks rules</h2>
			<p>A worn symbiont is treated as a magical object with the intelligent trait. Symbionts can’t be crafted by normal means. The normal statistics and rules for wearing or 
			using an item of its type still apply to a symbiont. In addition, symbionts have statistics other items lack.</p>
			<h3>Attribute Modifiers</h3>
			<p>While grafted symbiots gain the physical attribute (Str, Dex, Con) of their host, but always keep their Int, Wis and Cha modifier.</p>
			<h3>Communication and Languages</h3>
			<p>Symbionts communicate by empathy and telepathy. Telepathy function as it does for any creature, 
			while an empathic connection allows the symbiot to share only emotions. Empathic and telepathic connections are limited either by touch or to 
			a very short distance. If a symbiont understands any languages, they are listed in its Communication entry. However, a host always understand its symbiot and vice-versa.
			</p>
			<h3>Perception and Senses</h3>
			<p>An symbiont that has any sense of the world around them has a Perception modifier. Symbionts have only the senses listed within their entry. A symbiont with a host loses its limited senses and perceives the world through its host's sense.</p>
			<h3>Save</h3>
			<p>Unattached symbiots have their listed saves. However, while hosted, the symbiot take the For and/or Ref saves of its host, whichever is higher.</p>
			<h3>Skills</h3>
			<p>Symbiots have skill modifiers that fit their nature. They are quite often skilled in intimidation and deception. </p>
			<h3>Speed and action</h3>
			<p>Unattached Symbiots can move and act normally. They have the listed speed and movement type. However, an attached symbiot can't normally act without the consent of its host. Then all 
			symbiots activities use the host's actions for the turn.</p>
			<h3>Life</h3>
			<p>A symbiont is a living creature and have Hit Points. However, if the symbiont has a host, any damage to the symbiont will first deplete the 
			host's hit points before affecting the symbiont's own.</p>
			<p>Dealing damage to a symbiont attached to a dying host has the same effect as dealing damage directly to the host, increasing is dying condition value.</p>

			<h3>Symbiots Encounter</h3>
			<p>An encounter with a symbiot typically follows a predictable sequence. Initially, the prospective host is subjected to the symbiote’s empathic link, which is projected 
			from a concealed position nearby. This link elicits heightened curiosity, prompting the host to approach the source. As proximity increases, the symbiote emits emotional stimuli 
			characterized by sensations of affection and psychological comfort, encouraging physical contact. Upon tactile interaction, the symbiot may initiate a transient neural override, 
			facilitating a brief period of behavioral influence intended to predispose the host to accept parasitization.</p>
			<p>Additionally, symbiots are known to prefer approaching victims who are sleeping outdoors. Taking advantage of the stillness of the night, they move in silently and initiate contact 
			with the sleeping host. This state of reduced consciousness facilitates impulse override, allowing the symbiot to more easily establish a communion with the host organism</p>
			<h3>Communion with a Symbiot</h3>
			<p>Communion with a symbiot can be initiated in one of two ways. Once physical contact is established, the symbiot may initiate telepathic communication—employing diplomacy, 
			intimidation, or deception—to offer its services to the target. The victim, as a potential host, may then willingly choose to enter into communion with the symbiot.</p><p>Alternatively, 
			in last resort, the symbiots can induce a state of temporary madness via telepathy, compelling the victim to surrender briefly to its influence. This short-lived but effective loss of control allows the 
			symbiote to complete the communion without resistance.</p><p>Worn symbiot are considered invested item.</p>

			<h3>Living with a symbiots</h3>
			<p>Physiologically, the symbiote is fully integrated into the host’s metabolism. Nothing distinguishes the creature from its bearer—every wound, ailment, or affliction is borne 
			entirely by the host. The symbiote’s flesh constantly releases a psychoactive substance into the host’s bloodstream, rendering the body more susceptible to the symbiote’s psychic 
			influence.</p><p>Psychologically, life with a symbiote is marked by a constant and tense exchange with an internal voice—one noted for its cold detachment and unsettling cruelty. 
			The host must learn to coexist with this strange presence, a voice heard by no one else. Furthermore, they must navigate the challenges of maintaining this uneasy alliance on a daily 
			basis. This ongoing struggle for mental dominance, compounded by the effects of the psychoactive secretion, has been named by scholars: symbiosytis.</p>
			
			<h2>Symbiosytis</h2>
			<p>Parasitic symbiosis (or symbiosytis) is a near incurable disease of both body and mind, contracted by the host of a symbiote from the very first moment of their communion. The state of this infection is 
			directly tied to the symbiote's mental hold over its host, which, in turn, shapes the relationship between the two entities.</p>

			<h3>Stage 1 - Helpful Symbiot</h3>
			<p>This symbiot is willing to help its host, give advice, is proactive and responds favorably to most of its host's requests (at the GM's discretion). The host can use all of 
			the symbiot activation without any worries. Moreover, the symbiot often shows signs of <em>benevolent anticipation</em> toward its host.</p>
			<div class="column-break"></div>
			<h3>Stage 2 - Friendly Symbiot</h3>
			<p>This symbiot has a good attitude toward the host, but won't necessarily do more than just accept what he say. The host can use all of the symbiot activation without any 
			worries. Moreover, the symbiot often shows signs of <em>benevolent anticipation</em> toward its host.</p>

			<h3>Stage 3 - Indifferent Symbiot</h3>
			<p>This symbiot doesn't care about its host either way. The host can use all of the symbiot activation without much worries. But the symbiot may deny its activation and <em>Temporary madness</em> would likely occur if personal conflict arise (at the GM's discretion).</p>
			<h3>Stage 4 - Unfriendly Symbiot</h3>
			<p>This symbiot dislikes its host and doesn't want to help it. The host can't use any of the symbiot activation. Constant effect still apply. <em>Temporary madness</em> may occur without much reason.</p>
			<h3>Stage 5 - Hostile Symbiot</h3>
			<p>This symbiot actively works against its host. A strong sense of unease, coupled with constant whispered insults and threats in the host's mind, makes it difficult for them to think.
			The host suffer a -2 status penalty to Will saves and can't use any of the symbiot's activation. Constant effect still apply. <em>Temporary madness</em> often occur at the worst time for the host.</p>
