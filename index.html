			<h1>Symbionts</h1>
			<p>Symbiots are a special kind of creature that straddles the line between disease and magical objects. They are complete creatures, generally capable of surviving 
			apart from a host creature for at least some days. They are generally Tiny or smaller, and physically limited on their own. They survive by joining with 
			a host creature, usually granting the host certain benefits in exchange for the protection afforded by a larger body. This symbiotic relationship usually benefits 
			both parties (though for many the symbiont might better be described as a parasite). </p>
			<h2>Symbiots rules</h2>
			<p>A worn symbiont is treated as a magical object with the intelligent trait. Symbionts can’t be crafted by normal means. The normal statistics and rules for wearing or 
			using an item of its type still apply to a symbiont. In addition, symbionts have statistics other items lack.</p>
			<h3>Attribute Modifiers</h3>
			<p>While grafted symbiots gain the physical attribute (Str, Dex, Con) of their host, but always keep their Int, Wis and Cha modifier.</p>
			<h3>Communication and Languages</h3>
			<p>Symbionts communicate by empathy and telepathy. Telepathy function as it does for any creature, 
			while an empathic connection allows the symbiot to share only emotions. Empathic and telepathic connections are limited either by touch or to 
			a very short distance. If a symbiont understands any languages, they are listed in its Communication entry. However, a host always understand its symbiot and vice-versa.
			</p>
			<h3>Perception and Senses</h3>
			<p>An symbiont that has any sense of the world around them has a Perception modifier. Symbionts have only the senses listed within their entry. A symbiont with a host loses its limited senses and perceives the world through its host's sense.</p>
			<h3>Save</h3>
			<p>Unattached symbiots have their listed saves. However, while hosted, the symbiot take the For and/or Ref saves of its host, whichever is higher.</p>
			<h3>Skills</h3>
			<p>Symbiots have skill modifiers that fit their nature. They are quite often skilled in intimidation and deception. </p>
			<h3>Speed and action</h3>
			<p>Unattached Symbiots can move and act normally. They have the listed speed and movement type. However, an attached symbiot can't normally act without the consent of its host. Then all 
			symbiots activities use the host's actions for the turn.</p>
			<h3>Life</h3>
			<p>A symbiont is a living creature and have Hit Points. However, if the symbiont has a host, any damage to the symbiont will first deplete the 
			host's hit points before affecting the symbiont's own.</p>
			<p>Dealing damage to a symbiont attached to a dying host has the same effect as dealing damage directly to the host, increasing is dying condition value.</p>
			
			
			
			<!--<div class="column-break"></div>-->
			
			<h3>Symbiots Encounter</h3>
			<p>An encounter with a symbiot typically follows a predictable sequence. Initially, the prospective host is subjected to the symbiote’s empathic link, which is projected 
			from a concealed position nearby. This link elicits heightened curiosity, prompting the host to approach the source. As proximity increases, the symbiote emits emotional stimuli 
			characterized by sensations of affection and psychological comfort, encouraging physical contact. Upon tactile interaction, the symbiot may initiate a transient neural override, 
			facilitating a brief period of behavioral influence intended to predispose the host to accept parasitization.</p>
			<p>Additionally, symbiots are known to prefer approaching victims who are sleeping outdoors. Taking advantage of the stillness of the night, they move in silently and initiate contact 
			with the sleeping host. This state of reduced consciousness facilitates impulse override, allowing the symbiot to more easily establish a communion with the host organism</p>
			<h3>Communion with a Symbiot</h3>
			<p>Communion with a symbiot can be initiated in one of two ways. Once physical contact is established, the symbiot may initiate telepathic communication—employing diplomacy, 
			intimidation, or deception—to offer its services to the target. The victim, as a potential host, may then willingly choose to enter into communion with the symbiot.</p><p>Alternatively, 
			in last resort, the symbiots can induce a state of temporary madness via telepathy, compelling the victim to surrender briefly to its influence. This short-lived but effective loss of control allows the 
			symbiote to complete the communion without resistance.</p><p>Worn symbiot are considered invested item.</p>

			<h3>Living with a symbiots</h3>
			<p>Physiologically, the symbiote is fully integrated into the host’s metabolism. Nothing distinguishes the creature from its bearer—every wound, ailment, or affliction is borne 
			entirely by the host. The symbiote’s flesh constantly releases a psychoactive substance into the host’s bloodstream, rendering the body more susceptible to the symbiote’s psychic 
			influence.</p><p>Psychologically, life with a symbiote is marked by a constant and tense exchange with an internal voice—one noted for its cold detachment and unsettling cruelty. 
			The host must learn to coexist with this strange presence, a voice heard by no one else. Furthermore, they must navigate the challenges of maintaining this uneasy alliance on a daily 
			basis. This ongoing struggle for mental dominance, compounded by the effects of the psychoactive secretion, has been named by scholars: symbiosytis.</p>
			
			<h2>Symbiosytis</h2>
			<p>Parasitic symbiosis (or symbiosytis) is a near incurable disease of both body and mind, contracted by the host of a symbiote from the very first moment of their communion. The state of this infection is 
			directly tied to the symbiote's mental hold over its host, which, in turn, shapes the relationship between the two entities.</p>

			<h2>Silence the voices</h2>
			<p>Ridding oneself of a symbiote is an extremely difficult task, requiring patience, strength of character, and deep conviction. Most known methods are harsh on both body and mind, 
			and the majority leave the newly freed host with severe and permanent aftereffects.</p>
		
									
			<h3>Consentual disjunction</h3>
			<p>The most pleasant way to part with a symbiote is, of course, to convince it to end the communion on its own terms. That said, this kind of social intervention requires tremendous 
			patience. A symbiote will rarely agree to leave behind its only way of life and the comfort of a host unless offered a better alternative—and, paradoxically, unless it is convinced 
			to overcome its own fears. Such an effort can only truly begin, or have even the faintest chance of success, if the relationship between the host and the symbiote has lasted for several months, 
			if not years.</p><p>If the host has managed to convince their symbiote of the fairness of separation, the symbiote can end the communion within seconds, leaving no lasting trace on the host—except 
			for any permanent damage related to the symbiote’s nature. For instance, a lost eye or a lost tongue will not regrow.</p><p>Bringing up this option with a not friendly symbiote is a bad idea. Their jealous, 
			cruel, and sadistic nature can easily turn against the host who dares to suggest separation too often. In fact, simply mentioning the idea to an antagonistic symbiot can aggravate its Symbiosytis stage.</p>
			<h3>Dismemberement</h3>
			<p>The easiest way to get rid of a symbiot is, of course, to simply tear it from its host. With brute force and the help of bladed or piercing objects, the symbiot can be forcibly extracted from its 
			victim’s body. That said, this approach is difficult and dangerous—for both the host and those attempting the removal.</p><p>First of all, a symbiot is always aware of what its host knows. 
			As such, it's nearly impossible to catch a symbiot by surprise. A host considering the amputaion will certainly aggravate the symbiosytis by more than one stage (at the GM's discretion). This means that during 
			an extraction attempt, the symbiot will be fully conscious and, unsurprisingly, hostile toward the people trying to remove it. As a result, the patient and the extractor will have to face a constant barrage of 
			temporary madness induced by the symbiot.</p><p>Fortunately, a symbiot is also asleep when its host is asleep. So, those preparing the procedure usually wait for the host to fall asleep—or be rendered unconscious 
			by other means—before beginning.</p>
			<p>Finally, The removal of a symbiot is an impossible and deadly procedure if not performed by someone at least trained in medicine.</p>

						<div class="rule">Amputation is a difficult procedure that requires a methodical and well-prepared approach. First, the host must be restrained, either tied up or held by at least two 
						people stronger than them. It is imperative that the host be unable to move, escape, or struggle. By doing so the symbiositys worsen by two stage. You then spend the next 10 minutes 
						treating the host (you can't target yourself). Meanwhile, someone else can use any activities of 1 minute or less that can reduce the stage of an affliction to help for what is coming.</div>
						<div class="tab rule">Depending on the symbiot's hostility, both you and the host will undergo a barrage of desperate surge of Temporary Madness from the symbiot to make the host struggle and 
						makes you hesitant. For each stage of the symbiositys, you and the host must attempt a saving throw against the symbiot's symbiosytis'S DC. If the host is unwilling or is controlled due to a 
						stage 6 symbiosytis, count all of the host's saves to be failed.
						</div>

						<br>
					 </div>
					 <div class="tab rule">Then, finally, attempt a Medicine check against the the symbiot's symbiositys DC. The procedure is extremely traumatic for both the body and mind of the host. So even a 
					 successful outcome can still result in the patient's death. It is wise to prepare a first aid team or a healer to intervene immediately after the amputation.    					 
					 </div>
					 <div class="tab">
						<div class="rule result r4">As success but the drained condition is halved (rounded up) and host gains a +2 circumstance bonus to its saves against its psychic fracture.</div>

						<div class="rule result r1">As failure and the host gain bleeding damage equal to half of the symbiot's level.</div>
					 </div><br>
					 <div class="tab rule">However, the host's ordeal is far from over. At the moment of the severing, their mind suffers a painful psychic backlash. The host must attempt a basic Will save 
					 against the symbiot's symbiositys. That psychic fracture causes 1d6 mental damage for each of the symbiot's level. On a critical failure, the symbiot's voice becomes a permanent presence 
					 in the host's mind. From that moment on, they must contend with a faint but cruel and biting voice, frustrated by its powerlessness.

							<span class="rule">This small, beautiful scarab looks like a piece of jewelry until it flutters its shimmering blue wings, which glisten in the light as if covered with
							a slick of oil. A throwing scarab is a special symbiont—vicious in its own right, but also capable of providing its host with a throwing weapon. The throwing scarab prefers 
							to attach to its host on the exterior of the hand or neck, appearing like some strange decoration. The hard crystalline carapace can be plucked and used a a thrown weapon.
							In hand, that Shard is a <em>+1 dart</em> that dissolves in its target, dealing an additional 1d6 points of acid damage (doubling with a critical success). A plucked shard 
							dissolves harmlessly after 1 round if not thrown.<br/>
							
							<b>Activate—Drawing Shard <S0A></S0A></b> (manipulate) <b>Effect</b> You draw quickly the symbiot's shard. A new shard is then growing quickly to replace it and be ready at the start of your next round.</span>
