                     <p>The features that most set Eberron apart are its tone and attitude. The setting combines traditional medieval fantasy with <b>pulp action</b> and <b>dark adventure</b>. 
					 Make no mistake&mdash;the world of Eberron proudly takes its place among the D&amp;D worlds that have come before&comma; with a cinematic flair and an eye toward the best 
					 action-adventure movies ever filmed. The campaign&rsquor;s story elements were designed with this in mind.</p>
					 <p>The world of Eberron has a rich history built on heroic deeds&comma; evolving magic&comma; and the <b>wounds of a long&comma; devastating war</b>. In the 
					 wake of this Last War&comma; action&comma; adventure&comma; good&comma; evil&comma; and a <b>thousand shades of gray paint</b> the landscape in broad&comma; powerful strokes&comma; 
					 and ancient mysteries await discovery so that they too can influence the world and its people.</p>
					 <p><b>Magic</b> is built into the very fabric of the setting. It <b>pervades and influences everyday life</b>. It provides certain <b>comforts and conveniences</b> unknown in either 
					 the modern world or any world of medieval fantasy. Great cities where castles scrape the sky can be found throughout the continent of Khorvaire&comma; and a thriving 
					 aristocracy of merchant families controls much of the world&rsquor;s economy thanks to the edge given them by the mysterious and rare <b>dragonmarks</b>.</p>
					 <p>Heroes come in all shapes and sizes&comma; all classes and races. They travel the world&comma; battling villains and recovering fabulous treasure&comma; dealing with 
					 over-the-top action&comma; harrowing challenges&comma; cliffhanger situations&comma; narrow escapes&comma; and ominous mysteries that are as likely to shed light on centuries 
					 of secrets as they are to threaten the safety of the current day</p>

                              <p>The daelkyr are the lords of the plane of Xoriat, the Realm of Madness. A daelkyr’s horrible touch may causes disease or corruption, and its very 
							  presence can trigger madness and confusion. At least six daelkyr inhabit Eberron. </p>
							  <p> The daelkyr are immortal and endlessly patient, and their manner of thinking is almost impossible for mortals (or even other outsiders) to 
							  understand. For the daelkyr, destroying worlds appears to be a form of art, and until Xoriat and the Material Plane are again coterminous, the daelkyr
							  are indulging their other sordid escapades. Some are poets, musicians, or sculptors, although their works are invariably bizarre and alien to human 
							  senses. Their preferred canvas is flesh, for they are the makers of monsters. Dolgrims, dolgaunts, beholders, mind flayers, and other hideous 
							  aberrations are the legacy of the daelkyr—living weapons created to destroy life. The subterranean citadel of a daelkyr lord usually supports a 
							  garrison of dolgrims, dolgaunt lieutenants, and illithid commanders. Each daelkyr also has its personal creations, reflecting its own aesthetic 
							  tastes. One might have a preference for oozes. Another breeds psychic vermin, while a third crafts hideous and deadly plants. Their experiments—creating
							  new races by twisting existing creatures into new forms—take time and can not be represented in game terms. A daelkyr can polymorph a creature into something
							  else easily enough; however, creating a new species of monster such as the dolgrim takes years to accomplish.</p>
							  <p>  The ancient seals placed by the Gatekeepers trap the daelkyr beneath Eberron and keep Xoriat from becoming coterminous, but the daelkyr have not made a 
							  concerted effort to destroy these seals. Their motives are inscrutable&mdash;above all things, the daelkyr are the lords of the Realm of Madness. Insanity and 
							  corruption are the currency they deal in.</p>
							  <p>A daelkyr often resembles a perfectly formed athletic human, possessing unearthly beauty. Despite this outward appearance, daelkyr are sexless and do not 
							  reproduce. Daelkyr speak their own language, and can speak any language.</p>

							  couatls joined forces to defeat the Overlords, the aboleths have fled beneath the seas, where their cabals seek to return to their rightful rule of 
							  the world.</p>
							  <p>Aboleth remain largely physically unchanged over the eons of their existence in the world. Aboleths are fish-like amphibians of immense size, 
							  often reaching 20 feet in length and weighing up to 6,500 pounds, though they continue to grow as they age and some fantastically ancient specimens 
							  might reach 40 feet in length. They resembled a bizarre eel, with long, tubular bodies, as well as a tail at one end and two fins near 
							  the head and another along the back. Aboleths' mouths are lamprey-like, filled with serrated, jawless teeth. They have pink bellies, and four pulsating
							  blue-black orifices along the bottom of their bodies that secrete slime. They have a large tail for propulsion in the water, and tentacles along their 
							  side to drag them across the land. Aboleths see via three slit-like eyes that rest upon a bony ridge along its head.
							  </p>

                              <p>To this day, cabals of aboleths live beneath the ocean waves, away from the prying eyes of those that wish to destroy them. The aboleths have the 
							  perspective required to study and understand the Draconic Prophecy fully, and they have discovered segments of it hidden in the deep waters. The 
							  prophets seek vengeance against the dragons and intend to manipulate the Draconic Prophecy to suit their needs, and use it as a tool to destroy the 
							  dragons and wreak havoc on the land-dwelling creature by freeing the Elder Evils or help the remaining Daelkyr.

							  first created by the daelkyr during the Daelkyr War 9,000 years ago. Some scholars, though, propose that aboleths are largely a creation of Khyber, 
							  as do the dragons of the Chamber, who actively search for the remaining aboleths on Eberron.

                                 on the continent of Khorvaire. They assaulted the goblinoid Dhakaani Empire, decimating most of western Khorvaire.
                                 The daelkyr lords, masters of shaping reality, found joy in twisting the beings of Eberron to suit their own purposes.

							  have remained among the daelkyr and the dolgaunts, while others have started their own followings among the Cults of the Dragon Below. A rare few 
							  have abandoned the path of aggression for philosophy and reflection. Some choose to live beneath small towns or villages, manipulating events to 
							  provide the beholder with power or wealth. Still others continue to look for ways to bring their daelkyr masters back to Eberron.

                              <p>With long, cartilaginous limbs and gray skin, chokers easily hide in stony alcoves, rocky fissures, and darkened staircases to ambush their prey. 
							  The strange little aberrations prefer to pick off weak and solitary creatures, especially those that wander off from their packs or communities. 
							  A choker’s long, spongy arms are flexible but deceptively strong. The fingers can tighten rapidly and are ridged with spiky, tooth-like structures 
							  that provide an incredible grip. A choker typically strangles its prey to death, then drags the body off or dismembers it using crude tools if the 
							  body is too big to carry. If confronted or outnumbered, a choker tries to escape, often compressing into a tight passage to get away. Chokers that 
							  encounter humanoids exhibit intense curiosity about their culture, society, and the products of art and industry. This interest isn’t very deep—it 
							  just results in chokers that like killing people and collecting any of their items that seem sophisticated, such as jewelry, nice clothing, or written 
							  texts.

										  the creature into a space adjacent to itself. The creature must also be moved within the attacker’s reach against a melee attack or into a 
										  space between itself and the attacker against a ranged attack. The choker can’t use this ability to make the attacker target itself, even

							  Watery mucus drains from a dolgarr's recessed nasal cavity into the corners of its mouth, which gapes open to reveal 
							  ridges of teeth that look like jagged fingernails. Dolgarr are silent, stubborn and dim-witted individual.

                              <p>When the daelkyr emerged from Xoriat to conquer Eberron, they captured and transformed many of the world’s 
                                 indigenous creatures to create an army of hideous warriors. Dolgaunts, bred from hobgoblin stock, are cold and 
                                 efficient killers often placed in command of groups of chokers, dolgrims, and other creatures. A dolgaunt is blind 
                                 but can perceive its surroundings through the sensitive cilia that covers its skin. It can also absorb liquids through 
                                 these tendrils, allowing it to drain the vital fluids out of any creature it touches. A dolgaunt is about the same size 
                                 as a hobgoblin, but far leaner and bonier. 
                              </p>
                              <p>Dolgaunts live grim, ascetic lives spent training for battle. Forming monastic cells in the depths of Khyber, 
                                 they occasionally perform surface errands for their sinister masters or work with the Cults of Dragon Below. Dolgaunts 
                                 speaks Common in a disturbing pleasant voice. They have also developed a mode of communication that uses subtle movements 
                                 of their skin tendrils; this allows a dolgaunt to silently communicate with other dolgaunts within 30 feet.

                              <p>Born to follow orders, they seldom make use of imaginative tactics on their own. However, some dolgrim bands find their way to civilized areas, where they prey on travelers or farmers.</p>
                              <p>A dolgrim has two sets of arms, which are each controlled separately by one of the brains, 
                                 thus ensuring the coordination needed to control multiple sets of weapons. 
                                 In fact, most warrior will enter combat wielding a melee weapon, a crossbow, and a shield.

                              <p>A mind flayer stands around the same height as a human, typically between 5'4" and 6'2", having humanoid shape and narrow build. Its head resembles an octopus, 
							  with four writhing tentacles where its mouth is. Its skin color ranges from mauve to a greenish lavender, soft and damp like an amphibious creature, and constantly 
							  covered by a layer of glistening slime.</p>
							  <p>The mind flayer's most deadly physical feature is its tentacled mouth. A mind flayer's four prehensile tentacles can be extended from around 2 feet to to around 
							  4 feet in length, and the mind flayer can manipulate them with great precision. Its small, circular mouth is lined with rows of teeth.It constantly drips an oily 
							  slime. Despite lacking a jaw, the mind flayer is capable of speech.</p>
							  <p>The sinister illithids are natives of the plane of Xoriat. They serve the daelkyr while simultaneously pursuing their own agendas. Most mind flayers on Eberron 
							  have been trapped in Khyber with their masters, commanding cities of dolgaunts and dolgrims and working with the leaders of the Cults of the Dragon Below. In many 
							  ways, the mind flayers seem more interested in reopening the gates to Xoriat than the daelkyr themselves. The daelkyr are immortal and can afford to wait for 
							  another ten thousand years; the illithids are more concerned with the passage of time. In general, however, the minds of the illithids are as alien and difficult 
							  to understand as those of the daelkyr.</p>
