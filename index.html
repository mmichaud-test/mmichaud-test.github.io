						<p>Approximately 9,000 years ago, in the Age of Monsters, the plane of Xoriat became coterminous with the plane of Eberron. 
						During that time, the lords of Xoriat, an aberrant race known as the daelkyr, pierced the planar walls and launched an invasion of Eberron
						on the continent of Khorvaire. They assaulted the goblinoid Dhakaani Empire, decimating most of western Khorvaire.
						The daelkyr lords, masters of shaping reality, found joy in twisting the beings of Eberron to suit their own purposes.
						</p>
                        <h3 id="chapter-title-example-creature">Dolgrim</h3>
						<p>The dolgrims were the foot soldiers during the Daelkyr War against the 
						Dhakaani Empire.
						</p>
						<p>The average dolgrim stands 3 1/2 feet tall and weighs 55
							pounds&mdash;heavier than a goblin of similar size due to the
							musculature that supports the upper arms. A dolgrim is essentially two goblins crushed into one creature</p> 
						<p>Dolgrim usually have white, 
							pale-gray, or light-pink skin, though dolgrim warriors will sometimes 
							tattoo their bodies with garish colors and disturbing images. 
							
						</p>
						<p>A dolgrim has two brains fused into a single mass. Each with its own distinct personality, though one brain usually attains dominance at birth and imposes its personality on the other brain. Even so, a dolgrim will often have conversations with itself
						</p>
						<p>Dolgrims understand common but they don't seems able to speaks it.
							
						</p>
						   <h3 id="chapter-title-example-creature-creature-name">Dolgrim Warrior</h3>
                           <p>Dolgrims are raised in a brutal martial environment&comma;
							and most become warriors. They are bred to fear and obey
							daelkyr and dolgaunts&comma; and are occasionally sent to aid
							Cults of the Dragon Below.</p>
							<p>Born to follow orders, they seldom make use of imaginative tactics on their own. However, some dolgrim bands find their way to civilized areas, where they prey on travelers or farmers.</p>
							<p>A dolgrim has two sets of arms, which are each controlled separately by one of the brains, 
							thus ensuring the coordination needed to control multiple sets of weapons. 
							In fact, most warrior will enter combat wielding a melee weapon, a crossbow, and a shield.</p>
