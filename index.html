                     <p>The features that most set Eberron apart are its tone and attitude. The setting combines traditional medieval fantasy with <b>pulp action</b> and <b>dark adventure</b>. 
					 Make no mistake&mdash;the world of Eberron proudly takes its place among the D&amp;D worlds that have come before&comma; with a cinematic flair and an eye toward the best 
					 action-adventure movies ever filmed. The campaign&rsquor;s story elements were designed with this in mind.</p>
					 <p>The world of Eberron has a rich history built on heroic deeds&comma; evolving magic&comma; and the <b>wounds of a long&comma; devastating war</b>. In the 
					 wake of this Last War&comma; action&comma; adventure&comma; good&comma; evil&comma; and a <b>thousand shades of gray paint</b> the landscape in broad&comma; powerful strokes&comma; 
					 and ancient mysteries await discovery so that they too can influence the world and its people.</p>
					 <p><b>Magic</b> is built into the very fabric of the setting. It <b>pervades and influences everyday life</b>. It provides certain <b>comforts and conveniences</b> unknown in either 
					 the modern world or any world of medieval fantasy. Great cities where castles scrape the sky can be found throughout the continent of Khorvaire&comma; and a thriving 
					 aristocracy of merchant families controls much of the world&rsquor;s economy thanks to the edge given them by the mysterious and rare <b>dragonmarks</b>.</p>
					 <p>Heroes come in all shapes and sizes&comma; all classes and races. They travel the world&comma; battling villains and recovering fabulous treasure&comma; dealing with 
					 over-the-top action&comma; harrowing challenges&comma; cliffhanger situations&comma; narrow escapes&comma; and ominous mysteries that are as likely to shed light on centuries 
					 of secrets as they are to threaten the safety of the current day</p>

								 de pathfinder. Faque même si on est au kébekicitte, only english messages will follow...</p>
								 <p>Ho pis rien de ce qui suit est parole d'évangile, hein! J'm'amuse à faire des conversions en utilisant les PF Tools avec tout ce qui me fais tripper sur Eberron en tête,
								 mais jamais je bouderai parce que vous utilisez pas c'que j'ai fais, en fais j'espère que dans notre One note, vous metterez vos concoctions, question que je vous plagie.</p>

                              <h2>Aboleth</h2>
							  <p>Aboleths are considered one of the earliest evils of Eberron. Born at the dawn of time from the progenitor dragon Khyber, the aboleths once 
							  followed their Overlords, what they call the Elder Evils, in enslaving the world. Since the Age of Demons came to an end when the dragons and 
							  couatls joined forces to defeat the Overlords, the aboleths have fled beneath the seas, where their cabals seek to return to their rightful rule of 
							  the world.</p>
							  <p>Aboleth remain largely physically unchanged over the eons of their existence in the world. Aboleths are fish-like amphibians of immense size, 
							  often reaching 20 feet in length and weighing up to 6,500 pounds, though they continue to grow as they age and some fantastically ancient specimens 
							  might reach 40 feet in length. They resembled a bizarre eel, with long, tubular bodies, as well as a tail at one end and two fins near 
							  the head and another along the back. Aboleths' mouths are lamprey-like, filled with serrated, jawless teeth. They have pink bellies, and four pulsating
							  blue-black orifices along the bottom of their bodies that secrete slime. They have a large tail for propulsion in the water, and tentacles along their 
							  side to drag them across the land. Aboleths see via three slit-like eyes that rest upon a bony ridge along its head.
							  </p>
							  <h3>Aboleth prophets</h3>
                              <p>To this day, cabals of aboleths live beneath the ocean waves, away from the prying eyes of those that wish to destroy them. The aboleths have the 
							  perspective required to study and understand the Draconic Prophecy fully, and they have discovered segments of it hidden in the deep waters. The 
							  prophets seek vengeance against the dragons and intend to manipulate the Draconic Prophecy to suit their needs, and use it as a tool to destroy the 
							  dragons and wreak havoc on the land-dwelling creature by freeing the Elder Evils or help the remaining Daelkyr.
                              </p>

                              <p> The true nature of the aboleths has been obscured over time. Because of their aberrant nature, many scholars believe that the aboleths were 
							  first created by the daelkyr during the Daelkyr War 9,000 years ago. Some scholars, though, propose that aboleths are largely a creation of Khyber, 
							  as do the dragons of the Chamber, who actively search for the remaining aboleths on Eberron.

                              <p>Some aboleths form clusters seeking malevolent short-term goals known as "broods," ruled over by powerful "overseers." These broods are often accompanied by aboleth 
							  servitors or other minions, such as the boggard who are known to sometimes serve aboleth's overseers whom capitalize on the religious fervor of Gulunta followers

                              <p>Cadaver collectors are massive humanoid constructs built of stone and metal. These steeped creatures stand 12 feet tall and weigh 2 tons. They possess long plated 
							  arms that nearly drag along the ground, owing to the collectors' hunched shoulders. They possess a featureless, metallic oblong head, with glowing green eye sockets. 
							  Spikes of various lengths, some barbed and some not, jut out from the collector from all sides, including along its limbs. They walk on almost hooved metallic feet. 
							  Bodies of fallen fighters adorn the various spikes on the collector's body, with the collector adding new bodies to its collection as it discovers more fallen.
							  </p>
							  <p>This massive constructs is designed for one purpose: to explore the battlefield and collect the corpses to gather information on enemy forces, for medical or 
							  magical research, or more often than not, for resources in the creation of undead. First used in the Last War in the army of Karrnath, most cadaver collectors 
							  now scour the Mournland for bodies to harvest.
							  </p>
                              <p>While cadaver collectors can be controlled by their creators, they possess rudimentary minds, and masterless collectors will find new grounds to collect their dead. 
							  Controlled collectors often find themselves idle during peacetime.
                              </p>

                              <p>The daelkyr are the lords of the plane of Xoriat, the Realm of Madness. A daelkyr’s horrible touch may causes disease or corruption, and its very 
							  presence can trigger madness and confusion. At least six daelkyr inhabit Eberron. </p>
							  <p> The daelkyr are immortal and endlessly patient, and their manner of thinking is almost impossible for mortals (or even other outsiders) to 
							  understand. For the daelkyr, destroying worlds appears to be a form of art, and until Xoriat and the Material Plane are again coterminous, the daelkyr
							  are indulging their other sordid escapades. Some are poets, musicians, or sculptors, although their works are invariably bizarre and alien to human 
							  senses. Their preferred canvas is flesh, for they are the makers of monsters. Dolgrims, dolgaunts, beholders, mind flayers, and other hideous 
							  aberrations are the legacy of the daelkyr—living weapons created to destroy life. The subterranean citadel of a daelkyr lord usually supports a 
							  garrison of dolgrims, dolgaunt lieutenants, and illithid commanders. Each daelkyr also has its personal creations, reflecting its own aesthetic 
							  tastes. One might have a preference for oozes. Another breeds psychic vermin, while a third crafts hideous and deadly plants. Their experiments—creating
							  new races by twisting existing creatures into new forms—take time and can not be represented in game terms. A daelkyr can polymorph a creature into something
							  else easily enough; however, creating a new species of monster such as the dolgrim takes years to accomplish.</p>
							  <p>  The ancient seals placed by the Gatekeepers trap the daelkyr beneath Eberron and keep Xoriat from becoming coterminous, but the daelkyr have not made a 
							  concerted effort to destroy these seals. Their motives are inscrutable&mdash;above all things, the daelkyr are the lords of the Realm of Madness. Insanity and 
							  corruption are the currency they deal in.</p>
							  <p>A daelkyr often resembles a perfectly formed athletic human, possessing unearthly beauty. Despite this outward appearance, daelkyr are sexless and do not 
							  reproduce. Daelkyr speak their own language, and can speak any language.</p>

                              <p>Approximately 9,000 years ago, in the Age of Monsters, the plane of Xoriat became coterminous with the plane of Eberron. 
                                 During that time, the lords of Xoriat, an aberrant race known as the daelkyr, pierced the planar walls and launched an invasion of Eberron
                                 on the continent of Khorvaire. They assaulted the goblinoid Dhakaani Empire, decimating most of western Khorvaire.
                                 The daelkyr lords, masters of shaping reality, found joy in twisting the beings of Eberron to suit their own purposes.
                              </p>
                              <h3>Beholder</h3>
                              <p>A beholder is an eight foot tall orb, with one centrally located eye. Beneath that eye resides a mouth with large pointed teeth. Ten stalks 
							  erupt from the top of the orb, each with an eye on it. Each of these eyes has the ability to project an eye ray.   
                              </p>
                              <p>The beholders served as artillery in the armies of the daelkyr. However, since the defeat of their masters, some beholders 
							  have remained among the daelkyr and the dolgaunts, while others have started their own followings among the Cults of the Dragon Below. A rare few 
							  have abandoned the path of aggression for philosophy and reflection. Some choose to live beneath small towns or villages, manipulating events to 
							  provide the beholder with power or wealth. Still others continue to look for ways to bring their daelkyr masters back to Eberron.

                              <h3>Choker</h3>
                              <p>With long, cartilaginous limbs and gray skin, chokers easily hide in stony alcoves, rocky fissures, and darkened staircases to ambush their prey. 
							  The strange little aberrations prefer to pick off weak and solitary creatures, especially those that wander off from their packs or communities. 
							  A choker’s long, spongy arms are flexible but deceptively strong. The fingers can tighten rapidly and are ridged with spiky, tooth-like structures 
							  that provide an incredible grip. A choker typically strangles its prey to death, then drags the body off or dismembers it using crude tools if the 
							  body is too big to carry. If confronted or outnumbered, a choker tries to escape, often compressing into a tight passage to get away. Chokers that 
							  encounter humanoids exhibit intense curiosity about their culture, society, and the products of art and industry. This interest isn’t very deep—it 
							  just results in chokers that like killing people and collecting any of their items that seem sophisticated, such as jewelry, nice clothing, or written 
							  texts.

										  Athletics check, including its bonus to Grapple. If it succeeds against the grabbed or restrained creature’s Fortitude DC, the choker 
										  redirects the attack to that creature, and the attacker compares its attack roll result against the new target’s AC. The choker must move 
										  the creature into a space adjacent to itself. The creature must also be moved within the attacker’s reach against a melee attack or into a 
										  space between itself and the attacker against a ranged attack. The choker can’t use this ability to make the attacker target itself, even 
										  if it’s grabbing or restraining the attacker</span>

                              <h3>Dolgaunt</h3>
                              <p>When the daelkyr emerged from Xoriat to conquer Eberron, they captured and transformed many of the world’s 
                                 indigenous creatures to create an army of hideous warriors. Dolgaunts, bred from hobgoblin stock, are cold and 
                                 efficient killers often placed in command of groups of chokers, dolgrims, and other creatures. A dolgaunt is blind 
                                 but can perceive its surroundings through the sensitive cilia that covers its skin. It can also absorb liquids through 
                                 these tendrils, allowing it to drain the vital fluids out of any creature it touches. A dolgaunt is about the same size 
                                 as a hobgoblin, but far leaner and bonier. 
                              </p>
                              <p>Dolgaunts live grim, ascetic lives spent training for battle. Forming monastic cells in the depths of Khyber, 
                                 they occasionally perform surface errands for their sinister masters or work with the Cults of Dragon Below. Dolgaunts 
                                 speaks Common in a disturbing pleasant voice. They have also developed a mode of communication that uses subtle movements 
                                 of their skin tendrils; this allows a dolgaunt to silently communicate with other dolgaunts within 30 feet.
                              </p>

                              <p>The dolgrims were the foot soldiers during the Daelkyr War against the 
                                 Dhakaani Empire.
                              </p>
                              <p>The average dolgrim stands 3 1/2 feet tall and weighs 55
                                 pounds&mdash;heavier than a goblin of similar size due to the
                                 musculature that supports the upper arms. A dolgrim is essentially two goblins crushed into one creature
                              </p>
                              <p>Dolgrim usually have white, 
                                 pale-gray, or light-pink skin, though dolgrim warriors will sometimes 
                                 tattoo their bodies with garish colors and disturbing images. 
                              </p>
                              <p>A dolgrim has two brains fused into a single mass. Each with its own distinct personality, though one brain usually attains dominance at birth and imposes its personality on the other brain. Even so, a dolgrim will often have conversations with itself
                              </p>
                              <p>Dolgrims understand common but they don't seems able to speaks it.
                              </p>
                              <h3>Dolgrim Warrior</h3>
                              <p>Dolgrims are raised in a brutal martial environment&comma;
                                 and most become warriors. They are bred to fear and obey
                                 daelkyr and dolgaunts&comma; and are occasionally sent to aid
                                 Cults of the Dragon Below.
                              </p>
                              <p>Born to follow orders, they seldom make use of imaginative tactics on their own. However, some dolgrim bands find their way to civilized areas, where they prey on travelers or farmers.</p>
                              <p>A dolgrim has two sets of arms, which are each controlled separately by one of the brains, 
                                 thus ensuring the coordination needed to control multiple sets of weapons. 
                                 In fact, most warrior will enter combat wielding a melee weapon, a crossbow, and a shield.
                              </p>

                              <p>A gibbering mouther is a horrible creature seemingly drawn from a lunatic’s nightmares. It is an amorphous mounds of flesh, mouths, and eyes named after 
							  their incoherent gibbering. 
                              </p>
                              <p> This ooze-like creature thirsts after bodily fluids and seems to prefer the blood of intelligent creatures. While gibbering mouthers can be found across Eberron, they are particularly common in the 
							  swamps of the Shadow Marches and Q'barra. 
							  </p>
							  <p>A gibbering mouther is about 3 feet across 
							  and 3 to 4 feet high. It weighs about 200 pounds. Gibbering mouthers seems able to speak many languages, but say nothing other than gibberish.
                              </p>

                              <h3>Grell</h3>
                              <p>Grell are aberrations native to the plane of Xoriat, the Realm of Madness. They once wandered through to the world of Eberron through the soft spots between the 
							  planes until the Gatekeeper druids cast Xoriat far from the Material Plane.
							  </p>
							  <p>The wrinkled hide of a grell varies from a pale pink-gray to a faint purple-pink in coloration (with older specimens being darker in color than younger ones) which, 
							  combined with its damp skin that gleams wetly in poor light, means adventurers often mistake the creatures for disembodied brains. Grell skin is surprisingly leathery 
							  and tough; measuring several inches thick on the upper body of a grell.
							  </p>
							  <p>The only other external features of a grell are its ten strong, rubbery tentacles and its hard beak. The tentacles are at least 7 feet-long and made up of hundreds of 
							  ring-shaped muscles sheathed in a hide much thinner than the epidermis of the creature's body. The skin on each tentacle features sharp, hard barbs every 2–3 inches all the 
							  way down to almost the very tip. These barbs are hollow, allowing the grell to inject a paralytic venom into its prey, but can also be partially retracted to allow the grell
							  to manipulate objects it doesn't wish to pierce or tear. The barbs are made of a bony substance that bears more of a resemblance to the calcified shells that some molluscs secret than true bone, as it lacks marrow or blood vessels. The beak of a 
							  grell is made of the same substance.
							  </p>
							  <p>Grells are feral and solitary, they follow their alien motivations to live and hunt like animals. They deliberately live away from civilization, instead making 
							  their lairs in damp caves near roadways where they could pick off anyone unfortunate enough to either be wandering nearby at night, or that ventured into 
							  the grell's cave in search of water. Grell are still intelligent however, and move on before travelers begin avoiding the "haunted" road. 
							  </p>
							  <p>Although most grell speaks only Daelkyr, many manage to communicate in more common surface languages. After 
							  all, there's no better way to lure travelers than a plea for help they can understand.
                              </p>

                              <h3>Mind flayer</h3>
                              <p>A mind flayer stands around the same height as a human, typically between 5'4" and 6'2", having humanoid shape and narrow build. Its head resembles an octopus, 
							  with four writhing tentacles where its mouth is. Its skin color ranges from mauve to a greenish lavender, soft and damp like an amphibious creature, and constantly 
							  covered by a layer of glistening slime.</p>
							  <p>The mind flayer's most deadly physical feature is its tentacled mouth. A mind flayer's four prehensile tentacles can be extended from around 2 feet to to around 
							  4 feet in length, and the mind flayer can manipulate them with great precision. Its small, circular mouth is lined with rows of teeth.It constantly drips an oily 
							  slime. Despite lacking a jaw, the mind flayer is capable of speech.</p>
							  <p>The sinister illithids are natives of the plane of Xoriat. They serve the daelkyr while simultaneously pursuing their own agendas. Most mind flayers on Eberron 
							  have been trapped in Khyber with their masters, commanding cities of dolgaunts and dolgrims and working with the leaders of the Cults of the Dragon Below. In many 
							  ways, the mind flayers seem more interested in reopening the gates to Xoriat than the daelkyr themselves. The daelkyr are immortal and can afford to wait for 
							  another ten thousand years; the illithids are more concerned with the passage of time. In general, however, the minds of the illithids are as alien and difficult 
							  to understand as those of the daelkyr.</p>

                              <h3>Spectator</h3>
                              <p>Spectators have 3‒4 ft bodies, which weigh 250 lb. They have four eyestalks, as opposed to the typical ten of normal beholders, with two located on either side 
							  of the upper half of the body. A spectator's skin is very thick, lumpy, and rubbery, with numerous blood vessels visible on the surface. Like regular beholders, 
							  they have a single main eye in the middle of their floating bodies.</p>
							  <p>Seen as lesser beholder by the khyber denizens, spectators were made and breed to guard and protect things and rooms in the name of Daelkyrs, mind flayers and even beholder.
							  Solitary, they are suprisingly peaceful and would never attack unless seriously provoked. Spectators only willingly fight against those who disturbed what they are guarding or those who persistently pestered them.</p>
							  <p>Spectators are vigilant and trustworthy, and could be relied upon to protect items in any situations. They possessed two methods of behavior: 
							  a free-thinking mode and a contemplative mode. Free-thinking spectators would wander the world at will, openly, if cautiously, chatting with those they came 
							  across. In their contemplative state, they are philosophers who would spend over a century pondering vast philosophical questions. Approached in this state 
							  they were still friendly and enjoyed discourse but would soon after request to be left alone so as to continue philosophizing. </p>
							  <p>In the past centuries, many contemplative spectators left Khyber, most of the time by accident. Many wizards, nobles and members of House Kundarak tried to
							  convince them to take official duty. However, spectators dislike guarding things for lesser lifeforms, which most mortal would qualify as, and would only do so 
							  hesitantly. After promising to do so, however, their loyalty to their patron is absolute, guarding the object in question until their time was up. They pride 
							  themselves on their guardianship and refuse commands to do anything else until asked to guard something else.
                              </p>

			<h1>Symbionts</h1>
			<p>Symbiots are a special kind of creature that straddles the line between magical item and familiars. They are complete creatures, generally capable of surviving 
			apart from a host creature for at least some days. They are generally Tiny or smaller, and physically limited on their own. They survive by joining with 
			a host creature, usually granting the host certain benefits in exchange for the protection afforded by a larger body. This symbiotic relationship usually benefits 
			both parties (though for many the symbiont might better be described as a parasite). </p>
			<h2>Symbiots rules</h2>
			<p>Every symbiont has the intelligent trait. Symbionts can’t be crafted by normal means. Because of this, symbionts are always rare. The normal statistics and rules 
			for wearing or using an item of its type still apply to a symbiont. In addition, symbionts have a few statistics other items lack.</p>
			<h3>Perception and Senses</h3>
			<p>An symbiont that has any sense of the world around them has a Perception modifier. Symbionts have only the senses listed within their entry, 
			rather than the assumed assortment of senses that most creatures have. A symbiont with a host loses its limited senses and perceives the world through its host's sense.</p>
			<h3>Communication and Languages</h3>
			<p>Symbionts almost always have some means of communication. The most common ways are via empathy and telepathy. Telepathy function as it does for any creature, 
			while an empathic connection allows the symbiot to share only emotions. Empathic and telepathic connections are limited either to the symbiot’s host or to 
			a very short distance. If a symbiont understands any languages, they are listed in parentheses in its Communication entry. However, a host always understand its symbiot.
			</p>
			<h3>Skills</h3>
			<p>Symbiots might have skill modifiers for Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma-based skills that fit their nature.</p>
			<h3>Attribute Modifiers</h3>
			<p>Symbiots have Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma modifiers, though as inanimate creature, they don’t have Strength, Dexterity or Constitution entries.</p>
			<div class="column-break"></div>
			<h3>Save</h3>
			<p>Since they have their own minds, symbiots might be subject to mental effects that require a Will save. However for any other saves, they are considered objects.
			And while grafted to an host, they are considered attended object regarding possible effect requiring saves.</p>
			<h3>Symbiots agency</h3>
			<p>As a default, symbiots have control over all their own abilities, meaning an symbiot weapon could deny the effects of its powers if it so chose, and symbiots 
			perform their own activations when they wish. Symbiots can typically use 3 actions per turn, acting on their host’s turn. These actions don’t count toward their 
			host’s 3 actions. They have a reaction if any of their activations requires one.</p>
			<p>The symbiots have different agendas according to their particularities and functions. However, they all share the same apprehension, or even disgust, at thwarting 
			plans devised by the Daelkyr or their agents. Thus, using symbiots against the spawn of Xoriat is a risky operation.</p>
			<p>Beyond denying beneficial effects and communicating their displeasure, symbiots can usually influence or hinder their hosts in many ways. If the symbiot
			is a weapon or armor, it can at least adopt a <b>disruptive tendency</b> to make its host take a –2 circumstance penalty to associated checks and DCs, much as if the host were 
			using an improvised weapon or tool. But symbiot can have a greater effect, such as seizing control of its host’s body for a time, the symbiot’s entry includes those 
			abilities.</p>

			<h4>Investing a symbiot <S3A></S3A></h4>

		    other requirements (for most invested items, the only other requirement is that you must be wearing the item). This investiture lasts until you remove the symbiot. You 
			can invest no more than 10 items or symbiots per day. If you remove an invested symbiot, it loses its investiture. The item still counts against your daily limit after
