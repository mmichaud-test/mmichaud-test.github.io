                              <p>Approximately 9,000 years ago, in the Age of Monsters, the plane of Xoriat became coterminous with the plane of Eberron. 
                                 During that time, the lords of Xoriat, an aberrant race known as the daelkyr, pierced the planar walls and launched an invasion of Eberron
                                 on the continent of Khorvaire. They assaulted the goblinoid Dhakaani Empire, decimating most of western Khorvaire.
                                 The daelkyr lords, masters of shaping reality, found joy in twisting the beings of Eberron to suit their own purposes.

                              <p>The dolgrims were the foot soldiers during the Daelkyr War against the 
                                 Dhakaani Empire.
                              </p>
                              <p>The average dolgrim stands 3 1/2 feet tall and weighs 55
                                 pounds&mdash;heavier than a goblin of similar size due to the
                                 musculature that supports the upper arms. A dolgrim is essentially two goblins crushed into one creature
                              </p>
                              <p>Dolgrim usually have white, 
                                 pale-gray, or light-pink skin, though dolgrim warriors will sometimes 
                                 tattoo their bodies with garish colors and disturbing images. 
                              </p>
                              <p>A dolgrim has two brains fused into a single mass. Each with its own distinct personality, though one brain usually attains dominance at birth and imposes its personality on the other brain. Even so, a dolgrim will often have conversations with itself
                              </p>
                              <p>Dolgrims understand common but they don't seems able to speaks it.

                              <p>Dolgrims are raised in a brutal martial environment&comma;
                                 and most become warriors. They are bred to fear and obey
                                 daelkyr and dolgaunts&comma; and are occasionally sent to aid
                                 Cults of the Dragon Below.
                              </p>
                              <p>Born to follow orders, they seldom make use of imaginative tactics on their own. However, some dolgrim bands find their way to civilized areas, where they prey on travelers or farmers.</p>
                              <p>A dolgrim has two sets of arms, which are each controlled separately by one of the brains, 
                                 thus ensuring the coordination needed to control multiple sets of weapons. 
                                 In fact, most warrior will enter combat wielding a melee weapon, a crossbow, and a shield.

                              <p>When the daelkyr emerged from Xoriat to conquer Eberron, they captured and transformed many of the world’s 
                                 indigenous creatures to create an army of hideous warriors. Dolgaunts, bred from hobgoblin stock, are cold and 
                                 efficient killers often placed in command of groups of chokers, dolgrims, and other creatures. A dolgaunt is blind 
                                 but can perceive its surroundings through the sensitive cilia that covers its skin. It can also absorb liquids through 
                                 these tendrils, allowing it to drain the vital fluids out of any creature it touches. A dolgaunt is about the same size 
                                 as a hobgoblin, but far leaner and bonier. 
                              </p>
                              <p>Dolgaunts live grim, ascetic lives spent training for battle. Forming monastic cells in the depths of Khyber, 
                                 they occasionally perform surface errands for their sinister masters or work with the Cults of Dragon Below. Dolgaunts 
                                 speaks Common in a disturbing pleasant voice. They have also developed a mode of communication that uses subtle movements 
                                 of their skin tendrils; this allows a dolgaunt to silently communicate with other dolgaunts within 30 feet.
                              </p>
