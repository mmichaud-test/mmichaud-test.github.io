							  <p>Aboleths are considered one of the earliest evils of Eberron. Born at the dawn of time from the progenitor dragon Khyber, the aboleths once 
							  followed their Overlords, what they call the Elder Evils, in enslaving the world. Since the Age of Demons came to an end when the dragons and 
							  couatls joined forces to defeat the Overlords, the aboleths have fled beneath the seas, where their cabals seek to return to their rightful rule of 
							  the world.</p>
							  <p>Aboleth remain largely physically unchanged over the eons of their existence in the world. Aboleths are fish-like amphibians of immense size, 
							  often reaching 20 feet in length and weighing up to 6,500 pounds, though they continue to grow as they age and some fantastically ancient specimens 
							  might reach 40 feet in length. They resembled a bizarre eel, with long, tubular bodies, as well as a tail at one end and two fins near 
							  the head and another along the back. Aboleths' mouths are lamprey-like, filled with serrated, jawless teeth. They have pink bellies, and four pulsating
							  blue-black orifices along the bottom of their bodies that secrete slime. They have a large tail for propulsion in the water, and tentacles along their 
							  side to drag them across the land. Aboleths see via three slit-like eyes that rest upon a bony ridge along its head.
							  </p>
							  <h3 id="chapter-title-example-creature">Aboleth prophets</h3>
                              <p>To this day, cabals of aboleths live beneath the ocean waves, away from the prying eyes of those that wish to destroy them. The aboleths have the 
							  perspective required to study and understand the Draconic Prophecy fully, and they have discovered segments of it hidden in the deep waters. The 
							  prophets seek vengeance against the dragons and intend to manipulate the Draconic Prophecy to suit their needs, and use it as a tool to destroy the 
							  dragons and wreak havoc on the land-dwelling creature by freeing the Elder Evils or help the remaining Daelkyr.
                              </p>

                              <p> The true nature of the aboleths has been obscured over time. Because of their aberrant nature, many scholars believe that the aboleths were 
							  first created by the daelkyr during the Daelkyr War 9,000 years ago. Some scholars, though, propose that aboleths are largely a creation of Khyber, 
							  as do the dragons of the Chamber, who actively search for the remaining aboleths on Eberron.

                                 on the continent of Khorvaire. They assaulted the goblinoid Dhakaani Empire, decimating most of western Khorvaire.
                                 The daelkyr lords, masters of shaping reality, found joy in twisting the beings of Eberron to suit their own purposes.

                              <p>A beholder is an eight foot tall orb, with one centrally located eye. Beneath that eye resides a mouth with large pointed teeth. Ten stalks 
							  erupt from the top of the orb, each with an eye on it. Each of these eyes has the ability to project an eye ray.   
                              </p>
                              <p>The beholders served as artillery in the armies of the daelkyr. However, since the defeat of their masters, some beholders 
							  have remained among the daelkyr and the dolgaunts, while others have started their own followings among the Cults of the Dragon Below. A rare few 
							  have abandoned the path of aggression for philosophy and reflection. Some choose to live beneath small towns or villages, manipulating events to 
							  provide the beholder with power or wealth. Still others continue to look for ways to bring their daelkyr masters back to Eberron.

                              <p>With long, cartilaginous limbs and gray skin, chokers easily hide in stony alcoves, rocky fissures, and darkened staircases to ambush their prey. 
							  The strange little aberrations prefer to pick off weak and solitary creatures, especially those that wander off from their packs or communities. 
							  A choker’s long, spongy arms are flexible but deceptively strong. The fingers can tighten rapidly and are ridged with spiky, tooth-like structures 
							  that provide an incredible grip. A choker typically strangles its prey to death, then drags the body off or dismembers it using crude tools if the 
							  body is too big to carry. If confronted or outnumbered, a choker tries to escape, often compressing into a tight passage to get away. Chokers that 
							  encounter humanoids exhibit intense curiosity about their culture, society, and the products of art and industry. This interest isn’t very deep—it 
							  just results in chokers that like killing people and collecting any of their items that seem sophisticated, such as jewelry, nice clothing, or written 
							  texts.

										  space between itself and the attacker against a ranged attack. The choker can’t use this ability to make the attacker target itself, even

                              <p>When the daelkyr emerged from Xoriat to conquer Eberron, they captured and transformed many of the world’s 
                                 indigenous creatures to create an army of hideous warriors. Dolgaunts, bred from hobgoblin stock, are cold and 
                                 efficient killers often placed in command of groups of chokers, dolgrims, and other creatures. A dolgaunt is blind 
                                 but can perceive its surroundings through the sensitive cilia that covers its skin. It can also absorb liquids through 
                                 these tendrils, allowing it to drain the vital fluids out of any creature it touches. A dolgaunt is about the same size 
                                 as a hobgoblin, but far leaner and bonier.

                              <p>Dolgaunts live grim, ascetic lives spent training for battle. Forming monastic cells in the depths of Khyber, 
                                 they occasionally perform surface errands for their sinister masters or work with the Cults of Dragon Below. Dolgaunts 
                                 speaks Common in a disturbing pleasant voice. They have also developed a mode of communication that uses subtle movements 
                                 of their skin tendrils; this allows a dolgaunt to silently communicate with other dolgaunts within 30 feet.

                              <p>A dolgrim has two brains fused into a single mass. Each with its own distinct personality, though one brain usually attains dominance at birth and imposes its personality on the other brain. Even so, a dolgrim will often have conversations with itself

                              <p>Dolgrims are raised in a brutal martial environment&comma;
                                 and most become warriors. They are bred to fear and obey
                                 daelkyr and dolgaunts&comma; and are occasionally sent to aid
                                 Cults of the Dragon Below.
                              </p>
                              <p>Born to follow orders, they seldom make use of imaginative tactics on their own. However, some dolgrim bands find their way to civilized areas, where they prey on travelers or farmers.</p>
                              <p>A dolgrim has two sets of arms, which are each controlled separately by one of the brains, 
                                 thus ensuring the coordination needed to control multiple sets of weapons. 
                                 In fact, most warrior will enter combat wielding a melee weapon, a crossbow, and a shield.
